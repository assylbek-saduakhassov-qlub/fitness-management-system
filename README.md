## Project Description
The **fitness-management-system** is a C++ application designed to manage fitness-related data for administrators and members. It leverages object-oriented programming principles to provide a modular, maintainable, and scalable solution for fitness centers. The project includes various classes to handle different aspects of the system, such as user management, fitness tracking, and administrative tasks.

## Implementation Details

### Structure and Organization
The project is organized into the following modules:

- **Admin Module (`admin.h` and `admin.cpp`)**: This module contains the `Admin` class, responsible for managing administrative tasks, such as adding or removing members and accessing detailed fitness data.
  
- **Member Module (`member.h` and `member.cpp`)**: This module represents a `Member` class that handles individual fitness tracking, such as exercise routines and progress reports.

- **Fitness Module (`fitness.h` and `fitness.cpp`)**: Contains the `Fitness` class, which includes methods and attributes for managing fitness activities and routines.

- **Global Module (`global.h` and `global.cpp`)**: Contains global variables and utility functions used throughout the project to maintain data integrity and streamline operations.

- **Main Module (`main.cpp`)**: Acts as the entry point for the application, integrating all the modules and providing the main application logic.

### Features

1. **Admin Management:**
   - Add or remove members.
   - View and edit member details.
   - Manage fitness routines and progress data.

2. **Member Management:**
   - View personal fitness progress.
   - Access and modify personal details.
   - Engage with assigned fitness routines.

3. **Fitness Tracking:**
   - Log and track various fitness activities.
   - Access detailed reports of fitness progress over time.

4. **Modular Code Design:**
   - Each module is encapsulated in separate files (`.cpp` and `.h`), ensuring clean code organization and ease of maintenance.

5. **Efficient Data Handling:**
   - Uses optimized data structures and algorithms to handle and process fitness-related data efficiently.
